## Introduction

This project aims to develop a sign language detector and translator using machine learning techniques. The system will be able to recognize and interpret sign language gestures, translating them into text or spoken language for improved communication with individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.

## Topics

In our project, we focus on three key areas: 
- [Machine Learning](#machine-learning)
- [Sign Language](#sign-language)
- [Translator](#translator)

We provide a technology to translate signs into written or spoken language, study nonverbal communication, and educate computers to read and write signs.

## Project Status

This project is currently under active development and is being maintained.
